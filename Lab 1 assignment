Question 1: Arithmetic operations
2.7/2 = 1.35
2.7%/%2 = 1 #returns the integer quotient
2.7%%2 = 0.7 #returns the remainder
10+5i/2 = 10+2.5i
round (2.5) = 2
round (-2.5) = -2
2%/%4-1 = -1 #returns quotient that is 0 and then subtract -1
3*2**2 = 12 #returns the exponent value of 2**2 and then multiply with 3
7%/%4 = 1
7%%4 = 3 #returns remainder
-7%%4 = 1 #next number divisible by 4 is -8, so the difference between -7 and -8 is 1
 trunc(5.7) = 5 #returns the value before decimal
 trunc(-5.7)= -5
 Question 2: 
let num = 5.7;
print ("The value using floor function is= floor(num+0.5)")
Question 3:
let a=1, b=2, c=4;
a&b; #returns TRUE since both of them are non zero number
!a<b | c>b #returns TRUE since any one of the conditions gets satisfied
Question 4:
let x=c(5,3,7,8)
is.integer(x) #returns FALSE since all the numbers are floating variables like 5.00,3.00,7.00 and 8.00
is.numeric(x) #returns TRUE since all the numbers are numeric or floating variables
x<- integer(x) #Error in integer(x) : invalid 'length' argument
x<-as.integer(x)
is.integer(x) #numeric data got converted to integer value and now this command returns TRUE
Question 5: 
x <- sqrt(2)
x*x ==2 #returns FALSE
